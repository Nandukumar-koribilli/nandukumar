# 3D Solar System Simulation

## Overview
This project is a mobile-responsive 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js. It features the Sun at the center, eight planets orbiting with adjustable speeds, realistic lighting, background stars, planet labels, and a pause/resume feature.

## Features
- **3D Scene**: Sun and eight planets (Mercury to Neptune) rendered as spheres with Phong materials for realistic lighting.
- **Orbit Animation**: Planets orbit the Sun using THREE.Clock for smooth, frame-rate-independent animation.
- **Speed Control**: Individual sliders for each planet to adjust orbital speed in real-time.
- **Bonus Features**:
  - Pause/Resume button to control animation.
  - Background stars for a realistic space effect.
  - Labels above each planet for identification.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices with CSS media queries for control panel scaling.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Unzip**: Extract the project files from the provided zip file.
2. **Serve the Project**:
   - Place the files in a web server directory (e.g., using VS Code Live Server, or run `python -m http.server` in the project folder).
   - Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in a modern browser (note: some browsers may restrict local file access).
3. **Dependencies**: The project uses Three.js via CDN (`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js`), so an internet connection is required.
4. **Run**: Open the served URL or `index.html` in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari recommended for best performance).

## File Structure
- `index.html`: HTML structure for the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS for styling the control panel and canvas, including mobile-responsive design.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for Three.js scene setup, planet creation, animation, and speed controls.
- `README.md`: This file with setup and usage instructions.

## Usage
- **View the Simulation**: The 3D solar system loads automatically with planets orbiting the Sun.
- **Adjust Speeds**: Use the sliders in the control panel to change the orbital speed of each planet. The speed value is displayed next to each slider.
- **Pause/Resume**: Click the "Pause" button to stop the animation and "Resume" to continue.
- **Responsive Design**: Resize the browser window or view on a mobile device to see the responsive layout.

## Demo Video Notes
The demo video (2â€“3 minutes) includes:
1. **Simulation in Action**: Showing the orbiting planets and Sun with background stars.
2. **Speed Control**: Demonstrating real-time speed adjustments using sliders.
3. **Code Walkthrough**: Explaining the scene setup, planet creation, animation loop, and speed control logic in `script.js`, styling in `styles.css`, and structure in `index.html`.
4. **Folder Structure**: Highlighting `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and `README.md`.

## Notes
- The project uses `requestAnimationFrame` and `THREE.Clock` for smooth animations.
- Planet distances and sizes are scaled for visibility, not astronomical accuracy.
- Tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for performance and compatibility.
