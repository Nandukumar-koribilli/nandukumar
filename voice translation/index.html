            <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects by Nandu</h2>
            <h1>This is for Moon</h1>
            <p>The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and was formed about 4.6 billion years ago, likely after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body. The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), and it takes 27.3 days to complete one orbit. The Moon also rotates on its own axis in the same time, which means we always see the same side of the Moon from Earth. The other side, called the far side, was first seen by a Soviet spacecraft in 1959.</p>
            <p>The Moon has a diameter of 3,475 km (2,159 mi), which is about a quarter of Earth’s diameter. The Moon has a mass of 7.35 × 10^22 kg (0.01 Earths), which gives it a much weaker gravity than Earth. A person would weigh only 16.5% of their weight on Earth on the Moon. The Moon has no atmosphere, which means it has no weather and no sound. The Moon also has no liquid water, but it has some water ice in the polar regions.</p>
            <p>The Moon’s surface is rocky and covered with craters, mountains, valleys, and plains. The dark areas we see on the Moon are called maria, which are ancient lava flows. The bright areas are called highlands, which are older and more heavily cratered. The Moon has some volcanic activity, but it is mostly dormant. The Moon also experiences quakes, caused by the tidal forces of Earth.</p>
            <p>The Moon has been explored by many robotic and human missions. The first spacecraft to reach the Moon was Luna 1, launched by the Soviet Union in 1959. The first human to walk on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, as part of the Apollo 11 mission by the United States in 1969. The last human to visit the Moon was Gene Cernan, as part of the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Since then, the Moon has been visited by several orbiters, landers, and rovers from various countries and agencies.</p>
            <p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The first uncrewed mission to the Moon was in 1959 by the Soviet Lunar Program with the first crewed landing being Apollo 11 in 1969.</p>
            <h2>Moon Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Diameter:</strong> 3,475 km</p>
            <p><strong>Mass:</strong> 7.35 × 10^22 kg (0.01 Earths)</p>
            <p><strong>Orbits:</strong> The Earth</p>
            <p><strong>Orbit Distance:</strong> 384,400 km</p>
            <p><strong>Orbit Period:</strong> 27.3 days</p>
            <p><strong>Surface Temperature:</strong> -233 to 123 °C</p>
            <h2>Facts about the Moon</h2>
            <p><strong>The dark side of the moon is a myth.</strong> In reality, both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight; however, only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>
            <p><strong>The rise and fall of the tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.</strong> There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon. The bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.</p>
            <p><strong>The Moon is drifting away from the Earth.</strong> The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.</p>
            <p><strong>A person would weigh much less on the Moon.</strong> The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound so high in the air.</p>
            <p><strong>The Moon has only been walked on by 12 people; all American men.</strong> The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission, while the last man to walk on the Moon in 1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then, the Moon has only been visited by unmanned vehicles.</p>
            <p><strong>The Moon has no atmosphere.</strong> This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites, and solar winds, and has huge temperature variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on the Moon, and the sky always appears black.</p>
            <p><strong>The Moon has quakes.</strong> These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seismographs on their visits to the Moon and found that small moonquakes occurred several kilometers beneath the surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten core, just like Earth.</p>
            <p><strong>The first spacecraft to reach the Moon was Luna 1 in 1959.</strong> This was a Soviet craft, which was launched from the USSR. It passed within 5,995 km of the surface of the Moon before going into orbit around the Sun.</p>
            <p><strong>The Moon is the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System.</strong> At 3,475 km in diameter, the Moon is much smaller than the major moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Earth is about 80 times the volume of the Moon, but both are about the same age. A prevailing theory is that the Moon was once part of the Earth and was formed from a chunk that broke away due to a huge object colliding with Earth when it was relatively young.</p>
            <p><strong>During the 1950s, the USA considered detonating a nuclear bomb on the Moon.</strong> The secret project, known as “A Study of Lunar Research Flights” or “Project A119,” was meant as a show of strength during the Cold War when the USA was lagging behind in the space race.</p>
            <p>The Moon is important for Earth and humanity in many ways. It stabilizes Earth’s tilt and climate and causes the tides in the oceans. The Moon is also a source of inspiration, curiosity, and scientific discovery. It may also be a potential site for future colonization and resource extraction.</p>
